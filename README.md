  Basically a big gunpowder bomb that has a much bigger explosion power.

# Recipes

List of different recipes in the mod.
It will be much easier if you use [Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items) which lets you see items and their recipes easier. Currently you can't see firework table recipes using roughly enough items.
