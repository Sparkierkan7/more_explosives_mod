# More Explosives Mod

Adds stuff related to explosives like bombs and a way to craft gunpowder. If you are looking for explosives more fun than boring old tnt but nothing too crazy, this mod does just that.

Its focused more on old technology stuff to fit better in the game so if your looking for more modern-like stuff like missiles and modern hand grenades this is the wrong place.
