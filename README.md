# Recipes

List of different recipes in the mod.
It will be much easier if you use [Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items) which lets you see items and their recipes easier. Currently you can't see firework table recipes using roughly enough items.

## Fireworks Table Recipes

Hold the item you want to change in your main hand
and hold the item that will be used to change it in your offhand.
