- Maybe change ash recipe to smelting instead of blasting

- Maybe shorten time it takes to do some stuff like cook charcoal into ash

-Lower amount of ash used to make ash-water bucket













Random suggestion: pillagers have strange blueish metal parts and so do ravagers and other illagers maybe at something like illager steel
